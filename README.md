#I am currently working on a Vingenere Cipher Decryption Program
#The general basis of the program is to Encrypt and Decrypt messages (only capital letters)
You can use the program by selecting either 1 (encrypt) or 2 (decrypt) anything else will be an invalid choice. Let's say you choose option 1 then you will type the plain-text when it asks you. Then will you type the Key and after that It will give you the ciphered text. 
If you choose Decrypt it is opposite. You will type the ciphered text and then the key after that it will give you the plaintext.
